# NEXT DESIGN

## Introduction

This is a school project for the Frontend course at Medieinstitutet GÃ¶teborg. The objective of this project is to create a fully functional web shop using React, NextJS, TypeScript, and ChakraUI as our design system. The design and color theme of `NEXT DESIGN` are inspired by the existing interior store `NORDIC NEST`.

## Description

According to the project requirements, the web shop must consist of at least four pages: a home page, a product page, a checkout page, and a confirmation page.

### Home Page

The home page displays all available products categories. Users can click on a category to navigate to the products page.

### Product Page

On the product page, users can read the description of the selected product and add it to their shopping cart.

### Checkout Page

The checkout page is divided into two main sections:

#### Shopping Cart

- Lists added products with their image, title, quantity, and price.
- Displays the total price of the cart.
- Allows users to update the cart by changing the quantity or removing products.

#### Delivery Information

- Users must be logged in to view and fill out the delivery information form.
- The form includes fields for name, email, phone number, and address.
- The form fields are automatically populated where possible for convenience.

### Confirmation Page

Once the user has completed the checkout process, the confirmation page displays a confirmation message along with a unique order number.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Eleni001/netio.git
   cd netio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## Usage

To use the web shop, follow these steps:

1. **Browse Products:** Navigate to the home page to view all available categories.
2. **View Product Details:** Click on a product to go to the product page and read more about it.
3. **Add to Cart:** Add products to your shopping cart either from the home page or the product page.
4. **Login:** Ensure you are logged in to proceed to checkout.
5. **Checkout:** Navigate to the checkout page, review your cart, and fill out the delivery information.
6. **Confirm Order:** Complete the purchase to receive a confirmation message with your order number.

## Design System

The web shop utilizes ChakraUI for its design system, providing a consistent and responsive design. ChakraUI components ensure a cohesive look and feel across all pages.
